Task 1: Build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output should always drive 1 (or logic high).

moduel top_moudule ( out );
	output  out;
	assign out = 1'b1;
endmodule


Task 2: Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire.

module top_module (	in,	out	);
	input in;
	output out;
	wire out;
	assign out = in;
endmodule


Task 3: Create a module with 3 inputs and 4 outputs that behaves like wires that makes these connections:
